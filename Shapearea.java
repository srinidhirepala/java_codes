8.Write a Java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains two integers and an empty method named print Area (). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only the method print Area () that prints the area of the given shape.

abstract class Shape {
    int dim1,dim2;
    abstract void printArea();
}
class Rectangle extends Shape {
    int length, width;
    Rectangle(int length, int width) {
        this.dim1 = length;
        this.dim2 = width;
    }
    void printArea() {
        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle: " + (dim1*dim2));
    }
}
class Triangle extends Shape {
    int base, height;
    Triangle(int base, int height) {
        this.dim1 = base;
        this.dim2 = height;
    }
    void printArea() {
        System.out.println("Area of Triangle: " + (0.5 * dim1 * dim2));
    }
}
class Circle extends Shape {
    int radius;
    Circle(int radius) {
        this.dim1 = radius;
    }
    void printArea() {
        System.out.println("Area of Circle: " + (Math.PI *dim1 * dim1));
    }
}
public class Shapearea {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape[] shapes = {
            new Rectangle(5,3),
            new Triangle(2,6),
            new Circle(3)
        };
        for (Shape shape : shapes) {
            shape.printArea();
        }
    }
}
