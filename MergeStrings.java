7.Given two strings s1 and s2, your task is to merge those strings to form a new merged string. A merge operation on two strings is described as follows: Append alternating characters from s1 and s2, respectively, to merged String. Once all of the characters in one of the strings have been merged, append the remaining characters in the other string to merged String.

import java.util.Scanner;
class MergeStrings {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String s1, s2;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter first string: ");
        s1 = sc.next();
        System.out.println("Enter second string: ");
        s2 = sc.next();
        StringBuilder mergedString = new StringBuilder(); 
        int minLength = Math.min(s1.length(), s2.length());
        for (int i = 0; i < minLength; i++) {
            mergedString.append(s1.charAt(i)); 
            mergedString.append(s2.charAt(i));
        }
        if (s1.length() > minLength) {
            mergedString.append(s1.substring(minLength)); 
        } else if (s2.length() > minLength) {
            mergedString.append(s2.substring(minLength)); 
        }
        System.out.println("Merged String: " + mergedString);

    }
}
